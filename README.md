# AntiBoatFly

AntiBoatFly is a lightweight, non-simulation-based anti-boat exploitation plugin for Paper and Folia 1.21.7.

# How it works

AntiBoatFly works by first checking if the motion sent to the server is valid. If it isn't, the player will be reset to their original position. It also checks for speed per terrain, upon violation of this rule, the player will also be reset to the position they came from.

# Does it patch bypasses?

Yes, AntiBoatFly patches several common boatfly bypass techniques, including remounting exploits and eventless flying exploits. This includes generic boatfly.
